&lt;p&gt;*Lukas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-script&quot;&gt;Video Script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan finally launches the world’s smallest orbital rocket and SpaceX booster swims. This and more, now on kNews!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, Lukas here welcome to kNews for week 05/2018 and as always a big shout out to my kNews Boosters who support me creating these videos on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know it is not the most recent news as this comes out but I really want to feature every single week this year so I’m still catching up on my backlog. I hope you don’t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up was a SpaceX Falcon 9 that launched from Cape Canaveral. It went east following a 26 degrees inclined Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that usually means there was a communication satellite on board and indeed it was GovSat-1 built by Orbital ATK for Luxembourg. Once in its final orbit it will hover at 21.5 degrees east over Africa and will be able to each Europe, the Atlantic ocean, Africa, the Indian ocean and parts of Asia with its steerable dish antennas.  It has many purposes ranging from civilian to military applications. An example would be emergency satellite calls from ships in distress out in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise Falcon 9 launched with landing legs and grid fins attached although it would not attempt to land on its drone ship nor at the landing zone. The result was actually pretty funny but more on that in just a sec. Up top the booster was as always the upper stage carrying the payload protected by the two fairings which SpaceX is still trying to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch proceeded as expected, Falcon went up and then received a kick to the side to perform a turn towards its desired inclination. Roughly 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight the booster’s tanks are almost empty and it gets staged away to set the upper stage free which goes on with the main mission. The fairings separate shortly after and at least one of them is used to test SpaceX new recovery system. It basically re enters back into the atmosphere stabilized by cold gas thrusters which simply release pressurize gas in little puffs. Once below a certain speed the parachute gets released which is still a big problem for SpaceX. According to Elon Musk himself the main issue is the fairing size. It causes so much turbulences in the air that it is hard to operate a parachute above it. The goal is then to catch it with Mr. Stevens, a ship that is waiting in the ocean. It looks like parachuting things down in a controlled fashion is not as easy as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the booster also reentered back into the atmosphere and while there is no droneship waiting for it to come home, it still performed a landing burn. This one is however special since SpaceX wants to get more efficient at it so they now fire three engines continuously for landing. They previously fired three too but two shut down just before touchdown. It worked out well, much better than SpaceX actually thought. The booster sunk into the water and tipped over gently staying intact. Yep, it did not explode as it used to do. This is because it is highly pressurized to its limits and falling over means the pressure exceeds what the booster is designed to. So my personal speculation is, the booster sunk vertically into the water to then bounce back sideways or it had a really lucky wave that damped its impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk joked about pulling it all the way back to the coast but the sad truth is it was destroyed. The booster malfunctioned and did not release its pressure correctly and was therefore a hazard. Not knowing what was going to happen B1032 was attacked and destroyed I assume as part of a spontaneous training maneuver. However, the details are unclear and I’m not quite sure why they didn’t simply send the termination signal. The booster is packed with explosives just in case something goes wrong at lift off but I don’t know how much control SpaceX has about that when it’s landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back at the upper stage it has accelerated the payload up to the correct speed to release GovSat-1 which will go on with its mission to circularize its orbit on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up now in quick succession were a Soyuz for Russia which launched off of their new Vostochny launch site on February 1st. It’s destination was a low earth sun synchronous orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Long March 2D for China which launched from their northern launch site in Jiuquan. That already indicates a similar destination which was also a sun synchronous orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top Soyuz were 5 satellites, the two main Russian of type Kanopus-V and several nanosatellites. Most notably at least for me are four of type S-Net from Germany. These are the best satellites! Totally un-biased! But wait a second… S-Net: What does that remind me of… I forgot. Wasn’t too important I guess. These satellites are supposed to test a nanosat swarm. Instead of having a few rather complicated larger ones that can maneuver themselves around to sit in specific spots, this swarm would just float around randomly in an orbital plane to form a dense network sort of like a brain. Instead of talking to one satellite of the constellation you would essentially talk to the constellation as a whole just pointing your dish upwards into the sky. Terrific! We could for example use it to control autonomous drones and such since they hadn’t to bother pointing their antenna in the right direction, just up. The simplicity of each satellite would also make it much easier to produce them with a high degree of automation without many humans involved thus cheaper. That sounds like a really good idea if you ask me. But enough trolling, S-Net will not take over the world just yet since this is only a test and it is of course not designed to do that. Involved into the mission were also many students of the Tech-University in Berlin, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching on top Long March 2D is the main scientific payload CSES or China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite, and several nanosatellites. CSES is a collaboration between China and Italia which will gather data about earth’s proximity most notably the iono- and magnetosphere which interact with the sun’s radiation.This research will help to better understand how events like solar flares or the solar wind in general impact our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last rocket launch for that week happened on February 3rd in Uchinoura, Japan. The world’s smallest orbital launch vehicle SS-520 took off into an elliptic low to medium earth orbit inclined by 31 degrees as part of a demonstration mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top was a small nanosatellite called TRICOM-1R with a mass around 3 kg. It’s just a test and is not equipped with many instruments but cameras to take some nice pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launcher is a sounding rocket where sounding comes from sonde or probe. It typically shoots a 100 to 150 kg kg payload on a suborbital trajectory to take measurements and perform experiments. However, instead of a heavier payload it carried a third stage which can boost tiny payloads up to orbital speeds. It’s less than 10 meter tall and has a mass of 2.6 metric tons. That’s like a beetle pulling a small trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to get such a small rocket into orbit is thrust, a lot of it. Especially on the first two stages. Every second thrusting upwards counts because earth’s gravity pulls at it. The less time it takes the rocket to release all of its energy the less time it spends fighting gravity and losing speed. That’s quite difficult to achieve in KSP and my launcher weighs three times as much as SS520. That’s because KSPs parts are made out of lead or something to compensate for the smaller planet. It would be just too easy to get to orbit otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the spin stabilized rocket reaches space and orbit really fast where it releases its payload. While the first and second stage drop in the ocean the third will stay in space like the payload but the orbit will decay over time as it dips quite deep into the atmospheric remains at 150 kms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that shall conclude this episode and I hope to see you in the next one if you like.

On board is a cherry red Tesla Roadster and I discuss the launch in a kNews Special!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Lukas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2018/02/07):
  Wow! Falcon Heavy launched its payload successfully to orbit and what a sight that was! The side boosters separated flawlessly and so did the core stage. However, only the side boosters managed to land safely while the center core failed to ignite 2 of 3 engines at landing and crashed into the ocean at almost terminal velocity. The speed max. something reaches within the atmosphere where its weight and the drag balance each other out. The center core did not smash directly into the drone ship but still managed to damage two of its engines as it came in from the side. It remains unknown whether the drone ship can be fixed for the next launch or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the upper stage achieved another very important goal. It reignited 6 hours into the flight shooting the Tesla Roadster not only to Mars but beyond. But don’t expect any nice imagery because the batteries will be long flat before it even leaves our planet’s sphere of influence. Elon Musk stated that they may hold for a total of 12 hours. Sending HD data across space is quite demanding when it comes to enery consumption and the vehicle has no solar panels! It will now coast silently for a few months and ultimately reach the asteroid belt and Cere’s orbit before it does a deep dive back into the inner solar system again flying by earth’s orbit once again. However, it should not approach earth closely for many years to come but the final word is not yet spoken since the final trajectory was not expected and has to be simulated by SpaceX and or astronomers!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations to SpaceX for proving their design and hopefully waking up all their competitors who now have to seriously think about canceling/changing everything non-reusable and focus on more future proof rockets. As Elon Musk said during a press conference, a reusable Falcon Heavy will be barely more expensive than a Falcon 9 initially costing about 90 million dollars. Their heavy lift rocket itself will not out compete anyone just yet but the cost savings from reusing the boosters will allow SpaceX to fund their next and most important project - the BFR. This monster will be fully reusable and it will take an estimated amount of 4 years to develop it and perform its first maiden flight in the full stack consisting of the booster and the big interplanetry ship. 4 years is not a lot of time and considering that SpaceX has all the necessary software and data to land rockets wherever they want, it is not as unrealistic as it seems. The development speed will likely exceed the one of Falcon also taking into account a steadily growing company. Not only in size but also in knowledge. They just learn a whole lot of new stuff others don’t by reusing hardware and pushing the limits further out. Luckily others can learn from SpaceX’ faults and achievements to catch up quickly - if they want. The will to make it happen is very important and I believe public interest plays a big role in it. The more people ask tough questions regarding this issue the more they will have to think about solutions and in the end good answers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-script&quot;&gt;Video Script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delayed by many years and now finally here. Falco…. no, not that one Solo, SpaceX Falcon Heavy! Now on kNews!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Lukas here, welcome to this kNews Special and as always a big shout out to my kNews Boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’m the only one but it’s really hard to believe that the day has finally come and we will see this particular bird of prey fly for the first time. It will take off of the only operational launch site that supports it in Cape Canaveral. So yes, if it explodes on the launch pad that means SpaceX won’t attempt it anytime soon again. So whatever you wish for, make sure not exploding over the pad is on the very top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk himself said in an interview that he considers it a win even if they can only avoid just that. But why? Falcon Heavy is hyped up a lot and at least SpaceX tries to keep the expectations low. This is a test flight and there are many things that could go wrong because they are simply unknown. But that’s good because test flights exist to uncover flaws so they don’t happen on crewed missions in the future. So I’m pretty sure they will not be very gentle with Falcon Heavy on a test flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX as a private company somehow relies on the public trust and especially people who are not very familiar with spaceflight could treat an explosion during such a test as severe as during a Falcon 9 launch. It is of course not. A Falcon 9 explosion during flight would far more severe at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of it, the launch date is February 6th 2018 at 18:30 UTC from Cape Canaveral. There is a three hour long launch window so in case you are planning to watch it live, make sure to bring plenty of time and some snacks! The backup day is the day after should they run into trouble but so far at least the weather looks go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On board will be… well a cherry red Tesla Roadster, what else. One of the first cars Tesla produced. Now it of course looks silly to launch a car to space and maybe it really is, but test flights generally involve undisclosed dummy payloads which could’ve been even more silly in the past without anyone knowing it. Unlike government agencies who don’t really rely on marketing, SpaceX or Tesla for that matter does so it is not a bad idea to launch something that would hit all the front pages showing it off. But I think the most important reason for SpaceX is to simply reach more people and get them interested into space. Tesla’s destination is a Mars orbit which should not be confused with an orbit around Mars. The Mars orbit is the trajectory the planet follows around the sun so the Roadster will become a neighbor of Mars. It is yet unknown how close the Tesla will get but I personally don’t expect any imagery with a big Mars in the background unless they have a telescope on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falcon Heavy like its smaller brother Falcon 9 uses two core stages and as an addition two more first stages boosters as strap ons. If you are familiar with rocketry this will immediately remind you of the United launch Alliance’s Delta IV Heavy and they are indeed very similar when it comes to size. However, Delta IV uses cryogenic Hydrogen as fuel which is far less dense than Falcon’s Kerosene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a comparison liquid Hydrogen has a density of round about 70 kg/m³. That’s 14 times lower than water which weighs 1000 kg per cubic meter. These cubes here have the same mass essentially. Now, Kerosene is very similar to water when it comes to the mass per volume so you can imagine that a Hydrogen rocket is much bigger for its weight than a Kerosene one. The thing missing there is the liquid oxygen which mixes it all up again but that’s only a ballpark and not the exact relation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just important to understand why a Delta IV Heavy weighs in at 730,000 kg while Falcon Heavy although a bit more compact, has a mass of 1.42 million kg. That’s almost twice as Heavy as the currently biggest rocket out there and it therefore also needs twice the thrust to get off the ground and that means more noise and more boom should something go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dangerous part of the launch is the take off itself. Each of the rocket’s 27 Merlin engines pushes its exhaust out of the nozzle at speeds above the speed of sound. This means the exhaust gas generates a lot of strong pressure waves in the air which hit the ground and sadly also bounce back towards the vehicle. Now I’m sure SpaceX has done a lot of simulations but you can never be 100% sure. These off the ground bouncing sonic booms could make the long rocket body oscillate and oscillation means energy can build up. This energy could than make the rocket tanks experience more pressure they are designed to and fail so the rocket has to get away off the pad as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Falcon Heavy has successfully survived that part the next event to keep an eye on is the rotation it does. I’m not sure if and how they will rotate the rocket on its maiden flight but even KSP models that one pretty well. The side boosters have a lot of mass and rotating them around causes a lot of shearing forces at the coupling between all three bodies. This could again induce some kind of oscillation from wobbling around destroying the coupling and ultimately the vehicle. This is unknown territory for SpaceX and it all depends on how well their simulation tools predict the real behavior. I could imagine they also did real life tests by twisting and bending these in all possible directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is of course not the last challenge because soon after Falcon Heavy will go through its maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle. This is where its speed combined with the ambient air pressure generate the highest forces on the rocket body now pulling hard on the both side mounted boosters. This and the airflow around the rocket could again lead to some strange unknown oscillations which would of course again lead to an explosion mid air. However, at this point in flight at least the launch pad is safe so I’m pretty sure you will hear a lot of cheers in the stream already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last risky event is the strap-on booster separation. While I’m sure SpaceX has tested their mechanism on ground, having endured all these stresses during launch who knows if they will still work properly. Even separating off sync could lead to unknown destructive behavior but the worst part would be off course if one or both wouldn’t separate correctly. If something gets stuck while the booster tries to get lose Goodbye Falcon Heavy and Goodbye Cherry Red Tesla. That is really a lot that can go wrong in the first couple of minutes but if both boosters separate successfully and Falcon Heavy stays in one piece, this test launch was a full success already no matter what happens after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is pretty much standard Falcon 9 procedure. Be it the booster landings that follow or the upper stage release and burn towards Mars. Speaking of it, while the side boosters rotate and burn back towards the landing zone at land the core will go on pushing forward. As the core stage drains almost out of fuel it will also separate and attempt landing on a drone ship far out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. The upper stage will meanwhile continue to speed up its payload until it reaches escape velocity. The speed needed to leave earth and put the vehicle into an orbit around the sun maybe intersecting Mars orbit at some point. However, the reason I think the Tesla won’t flyby Mars directly is the launch window towards Mars opens in a few months from now around May and it’s just too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, in order to get to Mars somewhat efficiently you have to launch just before earth overtakes Mars on its orbit around the sun. This happens roughly every two years so it is pretty much coincidence that we are that close right now. If SpaceX wanted to flyby Mars they would probably wait a couple more months but I don’t know how fast the upper stage can speed up the payload. The Tesla seems incredibly light compared to regular satellites so there is a very very small chance that SpaceX could take a less efficient route. Instead of such a transfer which exactly intersects the Martian orbit at its Apoapsis, the highest point of its orbit, they could accelerate faster and push the trajectory closer towards the sun. This would mean the Roadster would take a quicker route reaching Mars orbit sooner. It would then of course be able to take a close up picture of the red planet but it would still not be able to stay there. It would simply fly by and get flung away into space orbiting the sun for millions of years without meeting Mars again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally doubt they would do that even if they could because flying by planets usually means you have to be able to do correction burns along the way to make really sure not to hit Mars by accident. A small deviation in the beginning has a huge impact on the overall trajectory. That would be way too complicated for such a test flight since then you also had to make sure everything is protected against micrometeorites, the sun’s radiation, solar flares and so on. So I don’t expect anything more but also not less than a few really cool pictures and maybe video of a Tesla Roadster drifting away from our pale blue dot. Good luck SpaceX and I really hope you guys are all able to watch it live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that shall conclude this Special episode an I hope to see you in the next one if you like.

This happened on December 12th 2017 and was as far as I know not streamed live nor announced, so I call it secret! Blue Origin was founded by Jeff Bezos who is also the head at the e-commerce giant amazon. Next to New Shepard, Blue Origin is also working on its orbital class launch vehicle called New Glenn which will use 7 BE-4 engines burning liquid methane and oxygen on its first stage, unlike New Shepard which burns liquid Hydrogen. However, New Shepard’s BE-3 engine will probably be used on an expendable third stage of the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Shepard seems to have been upgraded being called the “next generation booster” and the capsule now finally features real windows - which were previously only painted on. Shooting the capsule straight up it almost passed the Karman line at 99 km at its highest point - the Apoapsis. This was therefore strictly speaking not a “space flight” but it doesn’t really make a difference to the payload whether you cross 100 km or not. The border of 100 km arises from aviation where a plane traveling at this altitude had to reach orbital velocity in order to gain enough lift from its wings to stay up. This is because of the extremely low, yet existing air pressure and means wings are not needed anymore once above orbital velocity and 100 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both capsule and booster landed successfully afterwards and New Shepard once again delivered a pinpoint arrival on its landing area, which by the way got a new paint job. It could be similar to SpaceX’ one a more radar reflective material to enhance the accuracy, which could also double as a more durable coating to the extremely hot exhaust gas. However, that’s just speculation on my end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboard Crew Capsule 2.0 was no crew but not further specified commercial, educational and research equipment. On suborbital parabolic flights like these cargo still experiences weightlessness for a few seconds to minutes, which is enough time to perform many different experiments that are just better suited for free fall. An example for this would be the ice crystal formation in clouds. Watching droplets freeze in mid air is very hard to achieve in the lab. You can of course watch entire steam clouds freezing but individual particles not so much. In such a free fall environment on the other hand you can make droplets hover just in front a microscope to observe how they form to gain a better understanding of what is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the below linked video carefully you will also notice different reflective properties on the capsule windows. Some are highly reflective like chrome while others look much more see-through and dark. The purpose is unknown at the moment but could either be related to the experiments hiding behind them, or Blue Origin could be testing different window materials to figure out what is best for its future tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radiation especially in the Ultraviolet range (UV) is extremely high above the atmosphere and potential tourist eyes have to be protected from that. Adding reflective coating is not hard but comes with the big downside of also reflecting visible light you want to enjoy during flight coming off of earth. It would definitely lower the overall experience if everything would look like you’d watch through extremely dark sunglasses. The future will tell what Blue Origin will come up with but I’m positive they will figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

However, New Shepard’s BE-3 engine will probably be used on an expendable third stage of the rocket.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://blog.knews.space/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22004_New-Shepard-Crew-Capsule.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3Enil,%20%22creditlink%22=%3E%22%22%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">SpaceX to Launch Tesla Roadster to Mars</title><link href="http://blog.knews.space/vlogs/SpaceX-to-launch-Tesla-to-Space.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SpaceX to Launch Tesla Roadster to Mars" /><published>2017-12-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-12-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://blog.knews.space/vlogs/SpaceX-to-launch-Tesla-to-Space</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.knews.space/vlogs/SpaceX-to-launch-Tesla-to-Space.html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, it’s not a joke (as it seems). SpaceX’ Falcon Heavy will launch Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roaster to Mars on its maiden flight in January 2018 according to a tweet by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/936782477502246912&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. My illustration up top shows a Tesla Model X because this is the only one I got modeled in 3D which I used in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYuvOMnDRdc&quot;&gt;Tesla Project Loveday&lt;/a&gt;” entry. However, it is still unclear whether it will be one of the new 200 kWh Roadsters which will arrive at the market by 2020, or one if not the first Tesla Roadster Elon Musk ever owned himself. This would be quite emotional and a real loss for him should something go wrong! &lt;em&gt;knocks on wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.knews.space/assets/img/003_Musk-Tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Elon Musk Tweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Falcon Heavy is SpaceX’ yet heaviest and most powerful rocket to fly. Due to unexpected difficulties when it comes to “simply strapping more Falcon boosters to Falcon 9”, the maiden flight was delayed back multiple times. It was first accounced to fly in 2012 which was of course a very optimistic timeframe to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in space and separated from the rocket, the Tesla Roadster will coast to Mars and do a close flyby performing a swing-by or gravity assist around the red planet. Due to the lack of propulsion the Roadster will not be able to enter into a stable orbit and will instead be shot into outter space maybe even visiting other planets. However, this is just my speculation because no further details have been published yet. It’s unlikely that SpaceX would build a full-fledged spacecraft around the Roadster though. I assume attachments will mostly consist of solar panels, cameras and communication equiptment to send its data back to earth. A gyroscope or some cold gas thrusters would also make sense to change its orientation and maybe some basic radiators to keep its batteries cool. But who knows, maybe I’m completely wrong and they will turn the Roadster into Lone Starr’s Eagle 5. &amp;amp;128526;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its journey it will of course take a lot of images like selfies from itself and Mars and maybe Phobos or Deimos too - Mars’ moons. What seems rediculous is actually just part of a very risky test flight. Elon Musk himself said, he would consider it a “win” if the rocket clears the towers and does not cause any damage to the launch site. Other rockets often also use so called dummy payloads on test flights but these are of course usually much less exciting or at least not further detailed. There could be a lot cool and silly stuff in space we don’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falcon Heavy ignites 27 Merlin engines during launch which all shoot out their exhaust gases at speeds above the speed of sound. This leads to shock waves forming similar to sonic booms which not only hit the ground, but also reflect back at the vehicle making it hard to predict if everything will go well. SpaceX uses water cannons to fill the air with tiny droplets absorbing hopefully enough of the shock wave’s energy to keep dangerous oscillations away from Falcon Heavy’s highly pressurized body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think this is a brilliant marketing move - even if it’s not intented to be one - and might open up space to much more then just “rational” payloads. A Falcon Heavy is able to shoot 17 metric tons of payload to Mars in its expendable setup, maybe half of that as a reuseable rocket which would be still enough to shoot hundreds of mummified human remains to the red planet. Humanity would finally fulfill its dream to rest in peace among the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dec. 3rd: There is some new information about the story not being true and made up by Elon Musk, but these don’t refer to official tweets just a talk between Musk and TheVerge. Knowing Musk’s sense of humor a little I personally think he would rather troll TheVerge than to admit lying. At this point if it was indeed a joke it would be a toy Tesla glued to the payload playing music. That would still be a Tesla flying to Mars. Future will tell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dec. 2nd: I just noticed Elon Musk answered a question about the model of the car in the comments below his tweet. It will be a first generation Tesla Roadster.&lt;/li&gt;
