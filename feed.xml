&lt;h2 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As expected Long March 3B did not yet launch but will hopefully in the upcoming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long March 6 and 2C launched successfully and brought their payloads into the correct orbits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week was all about China and our sun smokes cigars? More on that on kNews!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Lukas here welcome to kNews for week 47/2017 and as always a big shoutout to my kNews Boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two or maybe three rockets launch this week in China and the first was a Long March 6 (長征) on Tuesday from Taiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboard were three Jilin satellites which are floating HD cameras for earth observation. They have a mid range ground resolution of 1.3 meters and will be placed in a polar orbit as most if not all of these gathering environmental data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their carrier is a new Long March 6 which is capable to bring round about a metric ton to such an orbit, which means each of them weighs roughly 300 kilograms. The rocket has three stages from which only the upper one burns a hypergolic fuel. The bottom two ones use Kerosene or Rocket-Propellant-1 like a Falcon 9 or russian Soyuz for example. These are not exactly environmentally friendly but non toxic which means the spent stages which drop to ground are no hazard to the environment. Big thumbs up for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long March 6 will head up and north right after liftoff towards the north pole. The gradual turn is accompanied by the rockets staging process as the lower boosters burn out, until only the upper one is left. This one will likely perform a multitude of burns to bring its payload into the desired orbit. The last steps include payload separation and probably also a short get-out-of-the-way maneuver by the upper stage to make sure it will never collide with its payload as it is being checked and put into service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was a Long March 2C on Friday from Xichang (西昌).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to were three YaoGan (遥感) satellites. These observe earth aswell but mostly for reconnaissance aka. spy purposes and not environmental monitoring like the previous three. This means they are top secret so there are no images I could share with you and my 3D model is also just made up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocket has two configurations and I don’t know which one was used to be honest. The most capable one has a solid booster as a third stage and two below which burn hypergolics. The amount of different rockets China has almost make it seem like they develop a new one for each flight. it’s crazy. Everytime I think “oh I got this one modeled already I stand corrected”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, similar to Long March 6 it will head north to achieve a similar orbit. It will probably be a little closer since spy satellites usually want to maximize their resolution which on the other hand leads to a shorter life span. Closer to ground they will experience more orbital decay and consume more fuel to keep them in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last chinese rocket to launch that week is a Long March 3B on sunday from Xichang as well. However, I’m not entirely sure if that will really happen since the source is not really known for being accurate. At least from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top would be the second pair of Beidou navigation satellites which I covered briefly not to long ago. Similar to the US GPS, Europe’s GALILEO or Russia’s GLONASS, these orbit earth in a medium orbit at round about 20,000 kilometers and an inclination of 56 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long March 3B is one of China’s bigger rockets capable to bring almost 12 metric tons to a low and 5-6 metric tons to such a medium earth orbit. It’s an older one so it uses mostly hypergolics on its four stages including the strap on boosters but has surprisingly a liquid Hydrogen and Oxygen third stage. That’s the most efficient kind of combusting fuel because of the extremely light exhaust particles which reach higher speeds than anything else. However, engine efficiency is only one part of the equation and whether it is worth or not to use it highly depends on the dry mass of the rocket. Hydrogen needs bigger tanks which are more heavy so a hydrogen rocket can not automatically bring more payload to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous two Long March 3B will not head over the poles but instead head south east when I interprete the last webcast correctly. It’s a little hard to follow due to all the kanji symbols so I can’t really read the map very well. However, the number next to degrees north was decreasing so I assume it flew south. Like the other rockets it will go through its launch procedure as it burns out its stages hopefully reaching its desired orbital injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want to talk about is our sun’s addiction. I’m just kidding, as you have maybe heard a cigar shaped asteroid from interstellar space called ‘Oumuamua (which is Hawaiian for scout) flew by our sun. Astronomers from all around the world were observing it during its 2 week highly visible passage. It caused excitement among scientists because it’s the first visitor which does probably not belong to our own solar system that we ever witnessed to fly by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how do they know that? Well, its orbit is hyperbolic and not elliptic like the usual comet from the outer solar system would have, which means that it will leave our solar system forever. There is a small chance that it got a gravity assist by an unknown planet though, which could orbit our sun 100 times more distant that earth does. So scientists don’t rule out that it could have been part of the early solar system and didn’t form around another star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, it’s weird cigar like shape is derived from its changing brightness. A change in brightness usually results from an asteroid’s rotation and unless it is perfectly spherical, it reflects more or less of our sun’s light depending on which side is pointing at us. Pretty straight forward but in theory it could instead just have different reflective properties on its surface. So instead of having a cigar like shape it could also have one dark and one bright side. This could have different reasons like a collision could have caused the asteroid to break apart and expose its more dense and shiny inner material. However, that’s just my  speculation and as far as I know astronomers prefer the cigar theory. Probably smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real reason is of course more complex since light changes its properties as it get reflected and we also see the comet from different perspectives as it flies by us. So I guess the shape is very certain but its origin not so much. What would you prefer? It being a visitor from interstellar space or flung into the inner solar system by a giant unknown planet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that shall conclude this week’s episode and I hope to see you in the next one if you like.

Yep, four rockets are planned to launch in a single week which is quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It seems like the Zuma mission was taken down for a longer period of time. The next launch is a Dragon capsule which does not need the fairing and can therefore launch without issues. The question is now whether Zuma will launch from the launch pad 39A or is moved to launch complex (LC) 40 which is back online after the AMOS (aka. “Facebook Satellite”) pad explosion in 2016. Pad 39A is now being worked on to upgrade it for the upcoming Falcon Heavy launches later this or early next year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Falcon 9 launch was delayed due to a fairing issue on another rocket. The Zuma mission will stand down until SpaceX know what’s going on just to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I confused two Soyuz launches with each other. The one supposed to launch on Nov. 18th launches a “Kosmos” satellite while the “Meteor” satellite is currently due to launch on Nov. 28th. Sorry about that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Lukas here, welcome to kNews for week 46 and as always a big shoutout to my kNews Boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about no episode for last week but I had some tonsil issues which are finally gone. I’m a cyclist and I showed no respect to the elements and got my well deserved punishment. Anyways, there were no punishments for Arianespace’s Vega and Orbital ATK’s Antares rockets. Both launched successfully last week bringing a communication satellite called Mohammed 6A to orbit for Morocco and a Cygnus spacecraft went to the ISS, which also docked to it Tuesday morning successfully. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First to launch this week was the United Launch Alliance’s Delta II rocket on Wednesday but it was shifted to Saturday at 9:47 UTC from Vandenberg at the US west coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top is JPSS-1, part of the Joint Polar Satellite System which monitors earth for weather forecasting purposes. It will join and replace Suomi NPP which’s 5 year long lifespan is coming to an end this year. But who knows how long it will actually operate. Just btw., Delta II will also carry 5 cubesats as a secondary payload on this mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the 39 meter relatively short and two staged rocket. Its upper stage engine features a large engine bell for maximum efficiency and will give its payload the final push burning hypergolic fuel. The first stage adds most to the rocket’s height and dwarfs the upper one quite a bit. Its core burns Kerosene while the 9, yes 9 strap on boosters are filled with solid propellant. This will be quite the show I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching from Vandenberg the rocket will head south to shot its payload into a polar orbit. Such an orbit is very typical for earth monitoring satellites because as the earth rotates below, it can cover almost the entire surface area. A satellite on a lower inclination like the ISS for example does never fly over the poles which leads to data inconsistencies. You just can’t make super accurate predictions if your data misses such big chunks. That’s why they can’t just strap on every instrument on the ISS and instead have to launch dedicated satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is a Chinese Long March 4C which launched earlier than expected on Tuesday from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top are two satellites, Fengyun 3D which is similarly to JPSS a weather satellite and Head-1, which will monitor the oceans and rivers for vessels like ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long March 4C has three stages all burning hypergolic fuels which I still find quite nasty. Burning these fuels gets rid of the toxicity but those not entirely empty stages still drop back to ground and the unburned remains get into the environment. Thankfully China renounces hypergolics on its latest of rockets so I hope the older ones will get replaced at some point in a not so distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Delta II, Long March 4C will head for a polar orbit, go through its staging as the lower fuel tanks burn out and hopefully inject the payloads into their desired orbits. The last one launching in 2016 ran into an undisclosed error dooming its payload but that was the only failure so far with 19 preceding successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number 3 to launch this week is a SpaceX Falcon 9 on Thursday or Friday depending on where you live from Cape Canaveral, what a busy week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top is Zuma, a secret satellite which was built in the US but it’s unknown what it does or who paid for it. However, Zuma is probably not as some people say Jacob Zuma, the south african politician. According to some rumours the name might also be just made up to lure people on the wrong track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, below are Falcon’s upper and first booster stage. It will be equipped with its landing gear so we will see another landing. This time it will be at landing zone 1 again so people living in Florida will be able to witness it live from the distance. I’d still recommend to follow their livestream in parallel which is very well made and of course linked in the info box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea in which direction the rocket will fly or what orbit it aims for but I’m pretty sure it will head out over the ocean since everything else would be forbidden launching from Cape Canaveral. Now what do you think about SpaceX launching top secret satellites like this? The satellite maker Northrop Grumman is known for military equipment and could in theory launch a laser weapon to space. Now this is of course made up but is a possible future scenario. Does it matter to you what that payload is and is there stuff you’d not want SpaceX to launch? I’m really curious about your opinion on this since nobody can force them as a private company to just launch everything. But of course, refusing to launch a satellite due to ethnic reasons could have a huge impact on their future missions. That’s a very tough situation to be in I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, after the booster has separated from the upper stage it will turn around and do a boost back burn reversing its trajectory back to where it came from. It will then do its spectacular reentry burn which can be captured in high detail from the ground when landing on land. I really like how they first ignite one, then three engines and how to exhaust plume changes its shape during that event. 
I know there are some sceptics out there who believe these booster landings are all CGI like mine. However, if you really think like that simply go visit Florida and watch it in person. There is also a ton of amateur footage of the landing.
Once the landing is done the livestream will probably again end sooner than usual due to the payload secret nature. So we won’t see it separating but SpaceX will as usual confirm a successful mission on their Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last rocket scheduled for this week is a russian Soyuz launching on Saturday from the new Vostochny cosmodrome in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On board is yet again another weather satellite for the russian Kosmos program called Meteor M2-1. Exact details are unknown as well so I can’t tell you much about it sadly.
Soyuz will interestingly launch without its famous 4 liquid fueled boosters on the sides and instead just use the core stage. That one is also different using a single fixed NK-33 engine on the bottom which uses four small engines as vernier thrusters to steer the rocket on the way up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the other two weather satellites Meteor will be placed in a circular polar orbit at an altitude of round about 800 to 900 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in the end some other information regarding my channel. I used to upload and host my craft files on a paid server and also tried to keep my little website updated. However, I just don’t enjoy maintaining all of this so I decided to scrub it and get rid of the cost. Sorry for those who use it! It’s not yet down so if you want a particular craft file linked there go get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that shall conclude this week’s episode and I hope to see you in the next one if you like.

&lt;p&gt;In the same breath I will also change the appearance of my website to be a little more optimized towards modern devices. I coded everything myself in the past but I am a terrible web developer so I went for a simplisitc &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/lagrange/&quot;&gt;Jerkyll Theme&lt;/a&gt; called Lagrange by “Paul Le”. I like it a lot and will of course personalize it over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I used to host my craft files I use in KSP to showcase the rocket launches. I will try to re-host them here but I’m not sure yet to which extent this is possible on Github Pages. Anyways, I hope you like it and see you on my channel!&lt;/p&gt;
