				<title>Blue Origin’s New Shepard launched secretly! </title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket shot their brand new “Crew Capsule 2.0” into a sub orbital trajectory above the Mojave desert. This happened on December 12th 2017 and was as far as I know not streamed live nor announced, so I call it secret! Blue Origin was founded by Jeff Bezos who is also the head at the e-commerce giant amazon. Next to New Shepard, Blue Origin is also working on its orbital class launch vehicle called New Glenn which will use 7 BE-4 engines burning liquid methane and oxygen on its first stage, unlike New Shepard which burns liquid Hydrogen. However, New Shepard’s BE-3 engine will probably be used on an expendable third stage of the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SpaceX to Launch Tesla Roadster to Mars</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, it’s not a joke (as it seems). SpaceX’ Falcon Heavy will launch Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roaster to Mars on its maiden flight in January 2018 according to a tweet by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/936782477502246912&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. My illustration up top shows a Tesla Model X because this is the only one I got modeled in 3D which I used in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYuvOMnDRdc&quot;&gt;Tesla Project Loveday&lt;/a&gt;” entry. However, it is still unclear whether it will be one of the new 200 kWh Roadsters which will arrive at the market by 2020, or one if not the first Tesla Roadster Elon Musk ever owned himself. This would be quite emotional and a real loss for him should something go wrong! &lt;em&gt;knocks on wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>kNews Space Has a New Home!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to cancel my webspace subscription because I basically just link to my content found on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/kNewsSpace&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel and do not host my own videos. It would be cool to have my videos hosted on my own server but webspace fast enough to deliver a good experience would be too expensive for me.&lt;/p&gt;
