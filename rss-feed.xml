				<title>Delta II, Falcon 9, Long March 4C and Soyuz launch!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;In my (almost) weekly kNews episode for week 46/2017 I cover Delta II, Falcon 9, Launch March 4C and a Soyuz rocket launch! Yep, four rockets are planned to launch in a single week which is quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>kNews Space Has a New Home!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to cancel my webspace subscription because I basically just link to my content found on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/kNewsSpace&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel and do not host my own videos. It would be cool to have my videos hosted on my own server but webspace fast enough to deliver a good experience would be too expensive for me.&lt;/p&gt;
