				<title>SpaceX to Launch Tesla Roadster to Mars</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, it’s not a joke (as it seems). SpaceX’ Falcon Heavy will launch Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roaster to Mars on its maiden flight in January 2018. My illustration up top of course shows a Tesla Model X because this is the only one I got modeled in 3D which I used in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYuvOMnDRdc&quot;&gt;Tesla Project Loveday&lt;/a&gt;” entry. However, it is still unclear whether it will be one of the new 200 kWh Roadsters which will arrive at the market by 2020, or one if not the first Tesla Roadster Elon Musk ever owned himself. This would be quite emotional and a real loss for him should something go wrong! &lt;em&gt;knocks on wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Soyuz's Fregat Upper Stage Burned Up!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Sad news from Russia. The recently launched Soyuz - which I covered a little prematurely in kNews for week 46/2017, has had an anomaly on its Fregat (frigate) upper stage!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Delta II, Falcon 9, Long March 4C and Soyuz launch!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;In my (almost) weekly kNews episode for week 46/2017 I cover Delta II, Falcon 9, Launch March 4C and a Soyuz rocket launch! Yep, four rockets are planned to launch in a single week which is quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>kNews Space Has a New Home!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to cancel my webspace subscription because I basically just link to my content found on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/kNewsSpace&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel and do not host my own videos. It would be cool to have my videos hosted on my own server but webspace fast enough to deliver a good experience would be too expensive for me.&lt;/p&gt;
