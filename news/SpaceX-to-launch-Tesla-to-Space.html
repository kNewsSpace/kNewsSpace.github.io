<p>Yep, it’s not a joke (as it seems). SpaceX’ Falcon Heavy will launch Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roaster to Mars on its maiden flight in January 2018. My illustration up top of course shows a Tesla Model X because this is the only one I got modeled in 3D which I used in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYuvOMnDRdc">Tesla Project Loveday</a>” entry. However, it is still unclear whether it will be one of the new 200 kWh Roadsters which will arrive at the market by 2020, or one if not the first Tesla Roadster Elon Musk ever owned himself. This would be quite emotional and a real loss for him should something go wrong! <em>knocks on wood</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.knews.space/assets/img/Musk_Tweet_Falcon_Heavy_Tesla.png" alt="Elon Musk Tweet" />
The Falcon Heavy is SpaceX yet heaviest and most powerful rocket to fly. Due to unexpected difficulties when it comes to “simply strapping more Falcon boosters to Falcon 9”, the maiden flight was delayed back multiple times. It was first accounced to fly in 2012 which was of course a very optimistic timeframe to begin with.</p>

<p>Once in space and separated from the rocket, the Tesla Roadster will coast to Mars and do a close flyby performing a swing-by or gravity assist around the red planet. Due to the lack of propulsion the Roadster will not be able to enter into a stable orbit and will instead be shot into outter space maybe even visiting other planets.</p>

<p>On its journey it will of course take a lot of pictures also known as “selfies” from itself and Mars and maybe Phobos or Deimes too - Mars’ moons. What seems rediculous is actually just part of a very risky test flight. Elon Musk himself said, he would consider it a “win” if the rocket clears the towers and does not cause any damage to the launch site. Other rockets often also use so called dummy payloads on test flights but these are of course usually much less exciting or at least not further detailed. There could be a lot cool and silly stuff in space we don’t know about.</p>

<p>Falcon Heavy ignites 27 Merlin engines during launch which all shoot out their exhaust gases at speeds above the speed of sound. This leads to shock waves forming similar to sonic booms which not only hit the ground, but also reflect back at the vehicle making it hard to predict what will happen. SpaceX uses water cannons to fill the air with tiny droplets absorbing hopefully enough of shack wave’s energy to keep dangerous oscillations away from Falcon Heavy’s body.</p>

<p>I personally think this is a brilliant marketing move - even if it’s not intented to be one - and might open up space to much more then just “rational” payloads. A Falcon Heavy is able to shoot 13 tons of payload to Mars which would be for example enough to shoot hundreds of human remains to the red planet. Humanity would finally fulfill its dream to rest in peace among the stars</p>
