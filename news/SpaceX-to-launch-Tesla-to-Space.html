  SpaceX to Launch Tesla Roadster to Mars

<p>Yep, it’s not a joke (as it seems). SpaceX’ Falcon Heavy will launch Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roaster to Mars on its maiden flight in January 2018 according to a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/936782477502246912">Elon Musk</a>. My illustration up top shows a Tesla Model X because this is the only one I got modeled in 3D which I used in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYuvOMnDRdc">Tesla Project Loveday</a>” entry. However, it is still unclear whether it will be one of the new 200 kWh Roadsters which will arrive at the market by 2020, or one if not the first Tesla Roadster Elon Musk ever owned himself. This would be quite emotional and a real loss for him should something go wrong! <em>knocks on wood</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.knews.space/assets/img/003_Musk-Tweet.png" alt="Elon Musk Tweet" /></p>

<p>The Falcon Heavy is SpaceX’ yet heaviest and most powerful rocket to fly. Due to unexpected difficulties when it comes to “simply strapping more Falcon boosters to Falcon 9”, the maiden flight was delayed back multiple times. It was first accounced to fly in 2012 which was of course a very optimistic timeframe to begin with.</p>

<p>Once in space and separated from the rocket, the Tesla Roadster will coast to Mars and do a close flyby performing a swing-by or gravity assist around the red planet. Due to the lack of propulsion the Roadster will not be able to enter into a stable orbit and will instead be shot into outter space maybe even visiting other planets. However, this is just my speculation because no further details have been published yet. It’s unlikely that SpaceX would build a full-fledged spacecraft around the Roadster though. I assume attachments will mostly consist of solar panels, cameras and communication equiptment to send its data back to earth. A gyroscope or some cold gas thrusters would also make sense to change its orientation and maybe some basic radiators to keep its batteries cool. But who knows, maybe I’m completely wrong and they will turn the Roadster into Lone Starr’s Eagle 5. &amp;128526;</p>

<p>On its journey it will of course take a lot of images like selfies from itself and Mars and maybe Phobos or Deimos too - Mars’ moons. What seems rediculous is actually just part of a very risky test flight. Elon Musk himself said, he would consider it a “win” if the rocket clears the towers and does not cause any damage to the launch site. Other rockets often also use so called dummy payloads on test flights but these are of course usually much less exciting or at least not further detailed. There could be a lot cool and silly stuff in space we don’t know about.</p>

<p>Falcon Heavy ignites 27 Merlin engines during launch which all shoot out their exhaust gases at speeds above the speed of sound. This leads to shock waves forming similar to sonic booms which not only hit the ground, but also reflect back at the vehicle making it hard to predict if everything will go well. SpaceX uses water cannons to fill the air with tiny droplets absorbing hopefully enough of the shock wave’s energy to keep dangerous oscillations away from Falcon Heavy’s highly pressurized body.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.knews.space/assets/img/003_falcon-heavy-exhaust.jpg" alt="Falcon Heavy Exhaust" /></p>

<p>I personally think this is a brilliant marketing move - even if it’s not intented to be one - and might open up space to much more then just “rational” payloads. A Falcon Heavy is able to shoot 17 metric tons of payload to Mars in its expendable setup, maybe half of that as a reuseable rocket which would be still enough to shoot hundreds of mummified human remains to the red planet. Humanity would finally fulfill its dream to rest in peace among the stars.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dec. 3rd: There is some new information about the story not being true and made up by Elon Musk, but these don’t refer to official tweets just a talk between Musk and TheVerge. Knowing Musk’s sense of humor a little I personally think he would rather troll TheVerge than to admit lying. At this point if it was indeed a joke it would be a toy Tesla glued to the payload playing music. That would still be a Tesla flying to Mars. Future will tell.</li>
  <li>Dec. 2nd: I just noticed Elon Musk answered a question about the model of the car in the comments below his tweet. It will be a first generation Tesla Roadster.</li>
</ul>
