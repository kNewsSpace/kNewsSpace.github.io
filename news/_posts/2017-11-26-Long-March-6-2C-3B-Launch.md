Two or three Chinese rockets are supposed to launch in week 47/2017 and astronomers are talking about nothing but cigars.

Updates
---
- As expected Long March 3B did not yet launch but will hopefully in the upcoming weeks. 
- Long March 6 and 2C launched successfully and brought their payloads into the correct orbits.

Last week was all about China and our sun smokes cigars? More on that on kNews! 

Hi Lukas here welcome to kNews for week 47/2017 and as always a big shoutout to my kNews Boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust! 

Two or maybe three rockets launch this week in China and the first was a Long March 6 (長征) on Tuesday from Taiyuan.

Onboard were three Jilin satellites which are floating HD cameras for earth observation. They have a mid range ground resolution of 1.3 meters and will be placed in a polar orbit as most if not all of these gathering environmental data. 

Their carrier is a new Long March 6 which is capable to bring round about a metric ton to such an orbit, which means each of them weighs roughly 300 kilograms. The rocket has three stages from which only the upper one burns a hypergolic fuel. The bottom two ones use Kerosene or Rocket-Propellant-1 like a Falcon 9 or russian Soyuz for example. These are not exactly environmentally friendly but non toxic which means the spent stages which drop to ground are no hazard to the environment. Big thumbs up for that.

Long March 6 will head up and north right after liftoff towards the north pole. The gradual turn is accompanied by the rockets staging process as the lower boosters burn out, until only the upper one is left. This one will likely perform a multitude of burns to bring its payload into the desired orbit. The last steps include payload separation and probably also a short get-out-of-the-way maneuver by the upper stage to make sure it will never collide with its payload as it is being checked and put into service.

Next up was a Long March 2C on Friday from Xichang (西昌).

Up to were three YaoGan (遥感) satellites. These observe earth aswell but mostly for reconnaissance aka. spy purposes and not environmental monitoring like the previous three. This means they are top secret so there are no images I could share with you and my 3D model is also just made up. 

The rocket has two configurations and I don’t know which one was used to be honest. The most capable one has a solid booster as a third stage and two below which burn hypergolics. The amount of different rockets China has almost make it seem like they develop a new one for each flight. it’s crazy. Everytime I think “oh I got this one modeled already I stand corrected”.

Anyways, similar to Long March 6 it will head north to achieve a similar orbit. It will probably be a little closer since spy satellites usually want to maximize their resolution which on the other hand leads to a shorter life span. Closer to ground they will experience more orbital decay and consume more fuel to keep them in orbit. 

The last chinese rocket to launch that week is a Long March 3B on sunday from Xichang as well. However, I’m not entirely sure if that will really happen since the source is not really known for being accurate. At least from my experience.

Up top would be the second pair of Beidou navigation satellites which I covered briefly not to long ago. Similar to the US GPS, Europe’s GALILEO or Russia’s GLONASS, these orbit earth in a medium orbit at round about 20,000 kilometers and an inclination of 56 degrees. 

Long March 3B is one of China’s bigger rockets capable to bring almost 12 metric tons to a low and 5-6 metric tons to such a medium earth orbit. It’s an older one so it uses mostly hypergolics on its four stages including the strap on boosters but has surprisingly a liquid Hydrogen and Oxygen third stage. That’s the most efficient kind of combusting fuel because of the extremely light exhaust particles which reach higher speeds than anything else. However, engine efficiency is only one part of the equation and whether it is worth or not to use it highly depends on the dry mass of the rocket. Hydrogen needs bigger tanks which are more heavy so a hydrogen rocket can not automatically bring more payload to orbit. 

Unlike the previous two Long March 3B will not head over the poles but instead head south east when I interprete the last webcast correctly. It’s a little hard to follow due to all the kanji symbols so I can’t really read the map very well. However, the number next to degrees north was decreasing so I assume it flew south. Like the other rockets it will go through its launch procedure as it burns out its stages hopefully reaching its desired orbital injection. 

The last thing I want to talk about is our sun’s addiction. I’m just kidding, as you have maybe heard a cigar shaped asteroid from interstellar space called ‘Oumuamua (which is Hawaiian for scout) flew by our sun. Astronomers from all around the world were observing it during its 2 week highly visible passage. It caused excitement among scientists because it’s the first visitor which does probably not belong to our own solar system that we ever witnessed to fly by. 

Now how do they know that? Well, its orbit is hyperbolic and not elliptic like the usual comet from the outer solar system would have, which means that it will leave our solar system forever. There is a small chance that it got a gravity assist by an unknown planet though, which could orbit our sun 100 times more distant that earth does. So scientists don’t rule out that it could have been part of the early solar system and didn’t form around another star. 

Either way, it’s weird cigar like shape is derived from its changing brightness. A change in brightness usually results from an asteroid’s rotation and unless it is perfectly spherical, it reflects more or less of our sun’s light depending on which side is pointing at us. Pretty straight forward but in theory it could instead just have different reflective properties on its surface. So instead of having a cigar like shape it could also have one dark and one bright side. This could have different reasons like a collision could have caused the asteroid to break apart and expose its more dense and shiny inner material. However, that’s just my  speculation and as far as I know astronomers prefer the cigar theory. Probably smokers.

The real reason is of course more complex since light changes its properties as it get reflected and we also see the comet from different perspectives as it flies by us. So I guess the shape is very certain but its origin not so much. What would you prefer? It being a visitor from interstellar space or flung into the inner solar system by a giant unknown planet?

Okay, that shall conclude this week’s episode and I hope to see you in the next one if you like. Auf Wiedersehen and Thank You for reading!
