  Blue Origin’s New Shepard launched secretly!

<p>Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket shot their brand new “Crew Capsule 2.0” into a sub orbital trajectory above the Mojave desert. This happened on December 12th 2017 and was as far as I know not streamed live nor announced, so I call it secret! Blue Origin was founded by Jeff Bezos who is also the head at the e-commerce giant amazon. Next to New Shepard, Blue Origin is also working on its orbital class launch vehicle called New Glenn which will use 7 BE-4 engines burning liquid methane and oxygen on its first stage, unlike New Shepard which burns liquid Hydrogen. However, New Shepard’s BE-3 engine will probably be used on an expendable third stage of the rocket.</p>

<p>New Shepard seems to have been upgraded being called the “next generation booster” and the capsule now finally features real windows - which were previously only painted on. Shooting the capsule straight up it almost passed the Karman line at 99 km at its highest point - the Apoapsis. This was therefore strictly speaking not a “space flight” but it doesn’t really make a difference to the payload whether you cross 100 km or not. The border of 100 km arises from aviation where a plane traveling at this altitude had to reach orbital velocity in order to gain enough lift from its wings to stay up. This is because of the extremely low, yet existing air pressure and means wings are not needed anymore once above orbital velocity and 100 km.</p>

<p>Both capsule and booster landed successfully afterwards and New Shepard once again delivered a pinpoint arrival on its landing area, which by the way got a new paint job. It could be similar to SpaceX’ one a more radar reflective material to enhance the accuracy, which could also double as a more durable coating to the extremely hot exhaust gas. However, that’s just speculation on my end.</p>

<p>Onboard Crew Capsule 2.0 was no crew but not further specified commercial, educational and research equipment. On suborbital parabolic flights like these cargo still experiences weightlessness for a few seconds to minutes, which is enough time to perform many different experiments that are just better suited for free fall. An example for this would be the ice crystal formation in clouds. Watching droplets freeze in mid air is very hard to achieve in the lab. You can of course watch entire steam clouds freezing but individual particles not so much. In such a free fall environment on the other hand you can make droplets hover just in front a microscope to observe how they form to gain a better understanding of what is actually happening.</p>

<p>Watching the below linked video carefully you will also notice different reflective properties on the capsule windows. Some are highly reflective like chrome while others look much more see-through and dark. The purpose is unknown at the moment but could either be related to the experiments hiding behind them, or Blue Origin could be testing different window materials to figure out what is best for its future tourists.</p>

<p>The radiation especially in the Ultraviolet range (UV) is extremely high above the atmosphere and potential tourist eyes have to be protected from that. Adding reflective coating is not hard but comes with the big downside of also reflecting visible light you want to enjoy during flight coming off of earth. It would definitely lower the overall experience if everything would look like you’d watch through extremely dark sunglasses. The future will tell what Blue Origin will come up with but I’m positive they will figure it out.</p>
