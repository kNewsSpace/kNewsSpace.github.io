I decided to cancel my webspace subscription because I basically just link to my content found on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/kNewsSpace) channel and do not host my own videos. It would be cool to have my videos hosted on my own server but webspace fast enough to deliver a good experience would be too expensive for me. 

In the same breath I will also change the appearance of my website to be a little more optimized towards modern devices. I coded everything myself in the past but I am a terrible web developer so I went for a simplisitc [Jerkyll Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/lagrange/) called Lagrange by "Paul Le". I like it a lot and will of course personalize it over time. 

However, I used to host my craft files I use in KSP to showcase the rocket launches. I will try to re-host them here but I'm not sure yet to which extent this is possible on Github Pages. Anyways, I hope you like it and see you on my channel!
