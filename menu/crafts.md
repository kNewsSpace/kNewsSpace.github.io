- (1) Creating crafts in KSP requires some sort of creative work and a .craft file is therefore protected by the copyright. As such you are not allowed to sell it as yours or sell it at all no matter for which price tag. This does also apply to non-creative derivatives meaning: Small modifications don't count as such.
- (2) I hearby grant you the right to use these crafts for all private purposes and public videos or screenshots you post on the internet. You are NOT
    required to credit me but it is very appreciated. However, if somebody asks you for that specific .craft file you have to point them here and not provide it by yourself in respect to (1).
- (3) Use these crafts with caution. Rapid unscheduled disassembly is not uncommon and I am not responsible for any damage done to your space agency.

How to Install KSP Craft Files
---

In order to install the craft files you have to unpack them (using freeware like 7Zip for example) into your Kerbal Space Program's save-file folder. Rockets belong into the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building) subfolder and planes into SPH (Space Plane Hanger). Using Steam as the game platform you had to navigate to:

> C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\saves\default\Ships\

The folder name "default" might be different for you depending on how you named your safe-file ingame. If you have not yet started to play the game there should be no folder created yet and you had to first launch KSP for the first time and start a new game. Important to note: These crafts will only work if you have the parts unlocked should you attempt to fly them in career mode. An alternative would be to create a new sandbox game with all parts unlocked right from the start. How the finished file path should look like you can see here:

> C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\saves\default\Ships\VAB\Falcon9.craft

or 

> C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\saves\default\Ships\SPH\Boeing747.craft
