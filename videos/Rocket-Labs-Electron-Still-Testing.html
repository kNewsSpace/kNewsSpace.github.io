<p>In kNews for week 50/2017 I mainly talk about the upcoming Soyuz launch to the ISS carrying three astronauts, but I also mention three other launches namely: Rocket Lab’s Electron, SpaceX’ Falcon 9 and Arianespace’s Ariane 5!</p>

<p>*Lukas</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>(2017/12/17): To round off the week Soyuz brought its astronauts to space safely. The Soyuz spacecraft will dock to the station on Tuesday December 19th which is the long track to the ISS. I’m not entirely sure why they chose this longer profile but it might be due to SpaceX’s Dragon capsule which arrived on Sunday. However, it could also be the other way around so that Dragon was allowed to launch just because Soyuz would chose the longer profile. Either way, best luck to those astronauts sitting in their tin can far above the world.</li>
  <li>(2017/12/16): Rocket Lab decided to give their staff some rest and push their Electron launch into 2018 due to some issues with the rocket and the weather. Better safe than sorry I would say.</li>
  <li>(2017/12/15): SpaceX Falcon 9 had a successful launch delivering Dragon into a low earth orbit while landing its booster at Landing Zone 1. There is only one launch left this year for SpaceX which will take place in Vanderberg. Should this one succeed SpaceX will leave 2017 with a perfect flight record without a failure. That’s not as self-evident as it might seem because SpaceX are constantly changing their hardware releasing new version of their boosters frequently. This year we moved from Block 3 to Block 4 while the final Block 5 is just around the corner.</li>
  <li>(2017/12/13): Ariane 5 brought its 4 passengers named Nicole, Zofia, Alexandre and Irina (drawing competition winners) into their desired circular medium earth orbits. They will now individually raise their trajectory over the course of several weeks until they can be put into service at their constellation slots. Adding 4 satellites will enhance the accuracy and availability of the GALILEO navigation system because more satellites means the chance to have some of them in the sky above is higher. It takes 4 to determine a location successfully but the more the better. Congratulations to Arianespace and ESA!</li>
</ul>

<p>Three astronauts go to space and four rockets launch, now on kNews!</p>

<p>Hi Lukas here welcome to kNews for week 50 and as always a big shout out to my kNews boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust!</p>

<p>Before I come to the launches I want to announce some changes to kNews. I used to try push out one video per week covering all the launches in great detail, which to be honest, is just too much. I tried to be fair and treat all payloads and rockets the same but even I have to say communication satellite number 105 is just not as exciting to talk about even though every rocket launch is cool to watch.</p>

<p>So I decided to pick out one topic per week which I will put my heart and soul into while only mentioning all the upcoming launches briefly in the beginning. Now, this is all not set in stone and I will listen to your feedback on that carefully to make some adjustments. The topic I focus on could be a particular launch but it could also be something else like a Special episode. My main goal is to release one episode per week consistently which I still fail to deliver very often. Anyways, let’s get started.</p>

<p>Launching this week are Rocket Lab’s Electron, SpaceX’ Falcon 9, Ariane 5 and a Soyuz. Three of them might actually launch on the same day!</p>

<p>First up is Electron which has a rather loose schedule. It could launch any day of the week at 1:30 UTC from the Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The main constraint is the weather I believe. Up top are 4 Cubesats, two of each from type Flock-2 and Lemur-2. All these are equipped with cameras to take picture from the ground below and are part of large Cubesat constellation belonging to the companies Planet Labs and Spire Global.</p>

<p>Next is a SpaceX Falcon 9 with an inaugural flight from Space Launch Complex 40 on Tuesday at 16:46 UTC. The launch pad bas broken due to a Falcon 9 exploding last year but it’s back. This means the other pad 39 can be finally changed to support Falcon Heavy. Up top Falcon 9 is a Dragon 1 spacecraft filled with cargo for the International Space Station. To get there it will be shot into a low earth orbit inclined at 51.6 degrees. The same one the ISS is orbiting at but of course just a little lower to catch up with it. A special thing to mention here is the booster and the capsule are both flight proven as SpaceX is referring to their reused hardware. The turnaround time is still very high but Block 5, the final iteration of Falcon 9, is not yet flying. Block 5 will include a lot of changes which make reusing the booster easier to finally step up the re-launch game to ultimately increase the launch cadence immensely.</p>

<p>Number three on the list is an Ariane 5 hopefully causing a rumble in the jungle on Tuesday as well at 18:36 UTC in Kourou, French Guiana. Up top are two GALILEO navigation satellites which will be shot into a 56 degrees inclined transfer orbit. Their destination is one of three medium earth orbital planes with an altitude of roundabout 22,000 km. The navigation constellation is not yet finished and Arianespace will continue to build it up for the european union to be a little more independent from the US GPS and Russia’s GLONASS which are quite similar.</p>

<p>The last launch this week aims for the International Space Station as well but that one is filled with astronauts so I will of course feature it in greater detail. It’s a Soyuz rocket currently scheduled to lift off on Sunday at 07:21 UTC from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>Up top the Soyuz rocket is the Soyuz spacecraft hiding behind a tight fairing. The pointy tower up top is the escape system which is basically a solid fueled booster firing its engines to the sides should something go wrong. It would separate the crew from the rocket in the early stages of the flight. However, it will be staged away mid flight once the rocket is in space to get rid of the weight since the spacecraft could separate from the rocket on its own should its engines fail. The escape system is also only designed for an in-atmospheric abort using grid fins to steer it at high speeds. This wouldn’t work in space and an abort so late into the mission could cause the capsule to tumble and spin uncontrollably. This would be very dangerous and life threatening for the astronauts on board.</p>

<p>As mentioned Soyuz will launch from Baikonur and head north east to follow an inclination of 51.6 degrees. As it speeds into the sky its flight computer will do most of the work and drop its empty stages on the way up. Since these empty tanks drop on ground Roscosmos actually has a ground crew to locate the crash sites and return the boosters. I’m not sure what they do with them but I guess there are some valuable materials on that rocket which could be recycled into new rockets. However, that’s just my speculation.</p>

<p>As the rocket heads up in the background let me introduce to you the astronauts joining Expedition 54 on the ISS. For Russia we have Anton Shkaplerov. He is 45 years old and was born in Ukraine. His career started as a Russian Air Force pilot and he later on graduated in Air Force Engineering. So far Anton has spent a year in space and by a year I really mean 365 days to be precise. Ahem, he was twice aboard the station already once in 2012 and once in 2014.</p>

<p>Next up is Kanai Norishige from Japan. He turns 41 this month and is a military doctor who did specialise in surgery I think. He later transferred to the Japan Self Defense Force Hospital in Kure which lies in the Hiroshima district of Japan. There he become a Diving Medical Officer after he has qualified himself as a diver in the US Navy. This will be his first flight to space where his diving experience could really pay off but I’m not sure if he will participate in any extravehicular activity.</p>

<p>And finally on board is also an US astronaut namely Scott Manley, err, I mean Scott Tingle. He is 52 years old and was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts. This gotta be one of the hardest to pronounce english words. Holy moly. Massachusetts. Anyways, Scott’s career is also dominated by military service as most astronauts. He is a commander in the US Navy and a test pilot. This will be also he first mission to space after he has qualified as an astronaut in 2011.</p>

<p>I wish these brave astronauts all the best luck on their ride to the station and of course also a nice christmas and new years eve they will share with the other crew members awaiting their arrival on the ISS.</p>

<p>Okay, that shall conclude this week’s episode and I hope to see you in the next one if you like. This show is mainly supported by crowdfunding so please consider to become a kNews Booster if you can spare a dollar or two. I’m currently saving for better hardware to render all those animations you see more quickly. Again big thanks to all who have supported me so far. Auf Wiedersehn and Thank you for reading!</p>
