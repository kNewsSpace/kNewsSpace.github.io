<p>In kNews for week 51/2017 I speak about the launches of SpaceX Falcon 9 and Japan’s H-IIA going more into detail on how SpaceX’ going to recover their fairings.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>(2017/12/23): Both rockets launched successfully and SpaceX surprisingly controlled the booster’s descent for a rather soft touchdown. It is unknown but also unlikely that the booster survived this maneuver. Launching to sun synchronous polar orbits means to launch along the earth’s terminator which separates the light from the dark at dawn. The cool part about this is while the sky is dark from a certain perspective, the rocket’s exhaust plume shines brightly in the sky being lit from the sun. This led to a social media storm about UFO sightings and what not on the US west coats. Pretty funny but also dangerous because there were multiple reported car accidents partly caused by this magnificent event. The drivers are obviously at fault because they have to keep their eyes on the road but it’s nonetheless an issue which could be overcome by giving out a radio warning in the future. Especially people who are completely unaware of rocket launches freaked out about seeing the ever expanding exhaut plume in the evening sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="video-script">Video Script</h2>

<p>SpaceX launches its Falcon 9, Japan HII-A and…. what is that. (dum dum dum)</p>

<p>Hey guys, Lukas here, welcome to kNews for week 51 and as always a big shout out to my kNews boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust! And of course, thanks to SquarePants for sponsoring this video.</p>

<p>Okay, jokes aside. The first rocket this week is Japan’s H-IIA beating SpaceX Falcon 9 by one minute launching on December 23rd at 1:26 UTC.</p>

<p>On top HII-A are the Global Change Observation Mission and a Super Low Altitude Test Satellite or SLATS for short. Both will be shot into a sun synchronous polar orbit and latter will slowly decrease its altitude below 200 km where it will demonstrate how satellites can be operated on such super low altitudes. Orbiting closer to ground allows a satellite to not only create more detailed images but it also simply orbits faster to make more orbits per day. It’s actually quite interesting because it has a very flat profile like a rod and solar panels which look like fins. This unusual body will allow it to consume fewer fuel than an ordinary one by minimizing the drag and therefore fuel consumption to offset the thicker air density. Sounds ideal for massive communication satellite constellations like the one SpaceX is planning since out of control satellites would burn up pretty quickly.</p>

<p>The second rocket to launch as mention a minute later is SpaceX Falcon 9. It will take off from Vandenberg at 1:27 UTC and will not attempt to land.</p>

<p>The reason is not the payload because the 10 Iridium satellites are well within Falcon 9’s margins to return the booster to the drone ship and SpaceX has done so 3 times in the past already. But more on that in just a minute. Up top are Iridium 31 to 40 from a total of 75. The upper stage and the booster are below. Since it will not attempt to land there is no need for grid fins or landing legs so it will fly without.</p>

<p>Similar to H-IIA before Falcon 9 will also head for a polar orbit and tilt south right after lift off. This gravity turn is necessary to not only get to space but stay there just in case you are new to my channel. A satellite flies in circles called orbits quickly to fight gravity pulling it towards the ground.</p>

<p>On the way there the main booster will stage away once its empty which is normally when SpaceX performs their one of a kind maneuver to land it back on a ship. However, not so today so the complete rocket will just crash into the ocean and become some kind of reef deep down under the sea.</p>

<p>The reason for this was not officially published yet but there are some rumours. One states that the drone ship is not operational and on its way to the east coast for the upcoming Falcon Heavy launch because the other ship is damaged. However, another rumour is completely different from that saying SpaceX just doesn’t need another old booster core. They have almost a dozen piling up already and you just can’t sell such hardware on ebay.</p>

<p>This particular booster is an older and used one from type Block 3. SpaceX is already flying Block 4 and Block 5 is just around the corner. Only the latest version will include the necessary changes to make it really reusable to fly more than twice.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you’re more interested into the Iridium payload I actually have a Special episode on that one you can check out if you like.</p>

<p>Now in the end I want to talk about the SpaceX MEGAKRAKEN. I made that name up to be honest but SpaceX has really built a kraken like ship. It is named Mr.Steven and features 4 gigantic arms in the back which look like they wanted to give someone a big hug. Or like a funny doodle. However, this ship has a very special use case and that is of course to catch the rockets fairings or at least one of them. I don’t know if it will be used this time around but it is at the Los Angeles port waiting for action.</p>

<p>How this would look like is a little speculative so please take this with a grain of salt. While the ship waits in the middle of the ocean like the drone ship, the fairings separate from the rocket and begin they glide down to re-enter back into the atmosphere. Keeping them from tumbling around out of control are cold gas thrusters similar to what the booster uses to orient itself. It’s basically just highly pressurized gas which is released in puffs through a small nozzle. Very inefficient but also very simple.</p>

<p>Once within the atmosphere the fairing would start by releasing a small inflated ball which it drags behind it to stabilize the atmospheric flight. Once below a certain speed the same ball would be used to pull out the steerable parachute. It would then glide towards the ship which would slowly speed up. On the ship could be some kind of lights maybe the fairing would follow once up close. It would keep the same heading and slowly descent to land on a net, stretched out around the four gigantic arms.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is a test and the second fairing will just crash into the ocean or if the crew can get the fairing off the net quickly enough for the second to land as well. The first could take a quicker route downwards while the other one would fly in circles like a hungry Falcon around the ship. It sounds really complicated but once everything is stable it should fly like a normal glider. Way easier than landing a booster. Whatever will happen I really really hope we will finally see some footage of it. That would be a cool christmas present!</p>

<p>Speaking of it, I wish you a merry christmas guys and in case there will be no more video next week also a happy new year. Okay, that shall conclude this episode and I hope to see you in the next one if you like. Auf Wiedersehen and thank you for reading!</p>
