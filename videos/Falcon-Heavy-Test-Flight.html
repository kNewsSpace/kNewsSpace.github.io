<p>SpaceX Falcon Heavy finally launches for the first time! On board is a cherry red Tesla Roadster and I discuss the launch in a kNews Special!</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(2018/02/07):
  Wow! Falcon Heavy launched its payload successfully to orbit and what a sight that was! The side boosters separated flawlessly and so did the core stage. However, only the side boosters managed to land safely while the center core failed to ignite 2 of 3 engines at landing and crashed into the ocean at almost terminal velocity. The speed max. something reaches within the atmosphere where its weight and the drag balance each other out. The center core did not smash directly into the drone ship but still managed to damage two of its engines as it came in from the side. It remains unknown whether the drone ship can be fixed for the next launch or not.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the upper stage achieved another very important goal. It reignited 6 hours into the flight shooting the Tesla Roadster not only to Mars but beyond. But don’t expect any nice imagery because the batteries will be long flat before it even leaves our planet’s sphere of influence. Elon Musk stated that they may hold for a total of 12 hours. Sending HD data across space is quite demanding when it comes to enery consumption and the vehicle has no solar panels! It will now coast silently for a few months and ultimately reach the asteroid belt and Cere’s orbit before it does a deep dive back into the inner solar system again flying by earth’s orbit once again. However, it should not approach earth closely for many years to come but the final word is not yet spoken since the final trajectory was not expected and has to be simulated by SpaceX and or astronomers!</p>

    <p>Congratulations to SpaceX for proving their design and hopefully waking up all their competitors who now have to seriously think about canceling/changing everything non-reusable and focus on more future proof rockets. As Elon Musk said during a press conference, a reusable Falcon Heavy will be barely more expensive than a Falcon 9 initially costing about 90 million dollars. Their heavy lift rocket itself will not out compete anyone just yet but the cost savings from reusing the boosters will allow SpaceX to fund their next and most important project - the BFR. This monster will be fully reusable and it will take an estimated amount of 4 years to develop it and perform its first maiden flight in the full stack consisting of the booster and the big interplanetry ship. 4 years is not a lot of time and considering that SpaceX has all the necessary software and data to land rockets wherever they want, it is not as unrealistic as it seems. The development speed will likely exceed the one of Falcon also taking into account a steadily growing company. Not only in size but also in knowledge. They just learn a whole lot of new stuff others don’t by reusing hardware and pushing the limits further out. Luckily others can learn from SpaceX’ faults and achievements to catch up quickly - if they want. The will to make it happen is very important and I believe public interest plays a big role in it. The more people ask tough questions regarding this issue the more they will have to think about solutions and in the end good answers.</p>

<p>Delayed by many years and now finally here. Falco…. no, not that one Solo, SpaceX Falcon Heavy! Now on kNews!</p>

<p>Hi Lukas here, welcome to this kNews Special and as always a big shout out to my kNews Boosters on Patreon. Thanks for your thrust!</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I’m the only one but it’s really hard to believe that the day has finally come and we will see this particular bird of prey fly for the first time. It will take off of the only operational launch site that supports it in Cape Canaveral. So yes, if it explodes on the launch pad that means SpaceX won’t attempt it anytime soon again. So whatever you wish for, make sure not exploding over the pad is on the very top of the list.</p>

<p>Elon Musk himself said in an interview that he considers it a win even if they can only avoid just that. But why? Falcon Heavy is hyped up a lot and at least SpaceX tries to keep the expectations low. This is a test flight and there are many things that could go wrong because they are simply unknown. But that’s good because test flights exist to uncover flaws so they don’t happen on crewed missions in the future. So I’m pretty sure they will not be very gentle with Falcon Heavy on a test flight.</p>

<p>SpaceX as a private company somehow relies on the public trust and especially people who are not very familiar with spaceflight could treat an explosion during such a test as severe as during a Falcon 9 launch. It is of course not. A Falcon 9 explosion during flight would far more severe at this point in time.</p>

<p>Speaking of it, the launch date is February 6th 2018 at 18:30 UTC from Cape Canaveral. There is a three hour long launch window so in case you are planning to watch it live, make sure to bring plenty of time and some snacks! The backup day is the day after should they run into trouble but so far at least the weather looks go.</p>

<p>On board will be… well a cherry red Tesla Roadster, what else. One of the first cars Tesla produced. Now it of course looks silly to launch a car to space and maybe it really is, but test flights generally involve undisclosed dummy payloads which could’ve been even more silly in the past without anyone knowing it. Unlike government agencies who don’t really rely on marketing, SpaceX or Tesla for that matter does so it is not a bad idea to launch something that would hit all the front pages showing it off. But I think the most important reason for SpaceX is to simply reach more people and get them interested into space. Tesla’s destination is a Mars orbit which should not be confused with an orbit around Mars. The Mars orbit is the trajectory the planet follows around the sun so the Roadster will become a neighbor of Mars. It is yet unknown how close the Tesla will get but I personally don’t expect any imagery with a big Mars in the background unless they have a telescope on board.</p>

<p>Falcon Heavy like its smaller brother Falcon 9 uses two core stages and as an addition two more first stages boosters as strap ons. If you are familiar with rocketry this will immediately remind you of the United launch Alliance’s Delta IV Heavy and they are indeed very similar when it comes to size. However, Delta IV uses cryogenic Hydrogen as fuel which is far less dense than Falcon’s Kerosene.</p>

<p>As a comparison liquid Hydrogen has a density of round about 70 kg/m³. That’s 14 times lower than water which weighs 1000 kg per cubic meter. These cubes here have the same mass essentially. Now, Kerosene is very similar to water when it comes to the mass per volume so you can imagine that a Hydrogen rocket is much bigger for its weight than a Kerosene one. The thing missing there is the liquid oxygen which mixes it all up again but that’s only a ballpark and not the exact relation between the two.</p>

<p>It’s just important to understand why a Delta IV Heavy weighs in at 730,000 kg while Falcon Heavy although a bit more compact, has a mass of 1.42 million kg. That’s almost twice as Heavy as the currently biggest rocket out there and it therefore also needs twice the thrust to get off the ground and that means more noise and more boom should something go wrong.</p>

<p>The first dangerous part of the launch is the take off itself. Each of the rocket’s 27 Merlin engines pushes its exhaust out of the nozzle at speeds above the speed of sound. This means the exhaust gas generates a lot of strong pressure waves in the air which hit the ground and sadly also bounce back towards the vehicle. Now I’m sure SpaceX has done a lot of simulations but you can never be 100% sure. These off the ground bouncing sonic booms could make the long rocket body oscillate and oscillation means energy can build up. This energy could than make the rocket tanks experience more pressure they are designed to and fail so the rocket has to get away off the pad as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>If Falcon Heavy has successfully survived that part the next event to keep an eye on is the rotation it does. I’m not sure if and how they will rotate the rocket on its maiden flight but even KSP models that one pretty well. The side boosters have a lot of mass and rotating them around causes a lot of shearing forces at the coupling between all three bodies. This could again induce some kind of oscillation from wobbling around destroying the coupling and ultimately the vehicle. This is unknown territory for SpaceX and it all depends on how well their simulation tools predict the real behavior. I could imagine they also did real life tests by twisting and bending these in all possible directions.</p>

<p>And this is of course not the last challenge because soon after Falcon Heavy will go through its maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle. This is where its speed combined with the ambient air pressure generate the highest forces on the rocket body now pulling hard on the both side mounted boosters. This and the airflow around the rocket could again lead to some strange unknown oscillations which would of course again lead to an explosion mid air. However, at this point in flight at least the launch pad is safe so I’m pretty sure you will hear a lot of cheers in the stream already.</p>

<p>The last risky event is the strap-on booster separation. While I’m sure SpaceX has tested their mechanism on ground, having endured all these stresses during launch who knows if they will still work properly. Even separating off sync could lead to unknown destructive behavior but the worst part would be off course if one or both wouldn’t separate correctly. If something gets stuck while the booster tries to get lose Goodbye Falcon Heavy and Goodbye Cherry Red Tesla. That is really a lot that can go wrong in the first couple of minutes but if both boosters separate successfully and Falcon Heavy stays in one piece, this test launch was a full success already no matter what happens after that.</p>

<p>The rest is pretty much standard Falcon 9 procedure. Be it the booster landings that follow or the upper stage release and burn towards Mars. Speaking of it, while the side boosters rotate and burn back towards the landing zone at land the core will go on pushing forward. As the core stage drains almost out of fuel it will also separate and attempt landing on a drone ship far out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. The upper stage will meanwhile continue to speed up its payload until it reaches escape velocity. The speed needed to leave earth and put the vehicle into an orbit around the sun maybe intersecting Mars orbit at some point. However, the reason I think the Tesla won’t flyby Mars directly is the launch window towards Mars opens in a few months from now around May and it’s just too soon.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, in order to get to Mars somewhat efficiently you have to launch just before earth overtakes Mars on its orbit around the sun. This happens roughly every two years so it is pretty much coincidence that we are that close right now. If SpaceX wanted to flyby Mars they would probably wait a couple more months but I don’t know how fast the upper stage can speed up the payload. The Tesla seems incredibly light compared to regular satellites so there is a very very small chance that SpaceX could take a less efficient route. Instead of such a transfer which exactly intersects the Martian orbit at its Apoapsis, the highest point of its orbit, they could accelerate faster and push the trajectory closer towards the sun. This would mean the Roadster would take a quicker route reaching Mars orbit sooner. It would then of course be able to take a close up picture of the red planet but it would still not be able to stay there. It would simply fly by and get flung away into space orbiting the sun for millions of years without meeting Mars again.</p>

<p>I personally doubt they would do that even if they could because flying by planets usually means you have to be able to do correction burns along the way to make really sure not to hit Mars by accident. A small deviation in the beginning has a huge impact on the overall trajectory. That would be way too complicated for such a test flight since then you also had to make sure everything is protected against micrometeorites, the sun’s radiation, solar flares and so on. So I don’t expect anything more but also not less than a few really cool pictures and maybe video of a Tesla Roadster drifting away from our pale blue dot. Good luck SpaceX and I really hope you guys are all able to watch it live.</p>

<p>Okay, that shall conclude this Special episode an I hope to see you in the next one if you like. Auf Wiedersehen and thank you for reading!</p>
